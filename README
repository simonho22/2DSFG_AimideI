2DSFG_AimideI
=============

This is a set of Matlab scripts for simulation of peptide amide-I 2DSFG spectras. 
The signal of 2DSFG is equal to the product of several factors. 

Sig = E*J*L*R*B

E = Electric field tensor, which describes polarization directions.
J = Jones matrix, which describes incident angles of lasers.
L = Fresnel coefficient, which describes surface reflection/transition properties.
R = Rotational tensor, which transforms molecular response from molecule from to lab frame.
B = Molecular response, which is the intrinsic molecular property of system. 

Given molecule structural file(in PDB format), the main script "2DSFG_AmindeI.m" will first 
call "GetAmideI.m" to extract structural infomation of amide I groups and start to build 
a two-exciton hamiltonian by "TwoExcitonH.m". The coupling between those modes are calculated 
base on Transition Dipole Coupling (TDC) model. 

After construction of the hamiltonian, the main script will call "Feynman_2DSFG_OuTerV2.m" to
calculate responses for different Feynman pathways. As a result, here we will have molecular 
response(B) of the system. Depending on the choose of ensemble average, the main script will
apply respective rotational tensor on B to generate molecular response in lab frame.

Here in this preliminary version, we neglect surface propeties by assuming L as indentity. 
In the future version, we will add this part back to the simulation. Later, the main script
apply J and E on the molecular response in lab frame to produce signal.

Finally, the main script call "Plot2DSFG.m" to make a contour plot with (X-axis, Y-axis) as
(Probe frequency, Pump frequency).
